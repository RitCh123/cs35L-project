## Get Started

### Cloning

To get started, locally clone the Github repoistory via the command:

```git clone https://github.com/RitCh123/cs35L-project.git```

Alternatively, you can download the tarball provided in the project submission.

**If you decide to clone the Github repoistory manually, you must separately add a ```.env``` file containg the list of database and Firebase passwords**.

### Running Development

Once you have obtained a local copy of the source code, run

``` cd game-reservation ```

to enter the program folder. Here, run 

```npm run dev```

to start both the development server (backend) and frontend.
